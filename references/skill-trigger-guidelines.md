# Skill Trigger Guidelines

Use this matrix to keep triggering specific and stable.

## Should Trigger

- "Create a board deck from these PDFs and spreadsheets."
- "Turn these files into a presentation with charts."
- "Build a Q4 results deck and export to pptx and pdf."
- "Regenerate slide 4 only and keep slides 2 and 3 locked."
- "Rerun build and export for this deck config."

## Should Not Trigger

- "Design a single hero image for a website."
- "Make one chart from this CSV in markdown only."
- "Rewrite this paragraph to sound more executive."
- "Help me debug a Python function unrelated to deck generation."

## Trigger Tuning Rules

- Put outcome and trigger phrases in frontmatter description.
- Include specific phrases users actually say (create deck, turn docs into slides, export pptx).
- Add explicit non-goals to prevent over-triggering.
- Keep description under 1024 characters.
