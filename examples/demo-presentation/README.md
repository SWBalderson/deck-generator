# Demo Presentation

Example source documents for testing the deck-generator skill.

## Source Files

- `source_docs/q4_strategy_brief.md` — Strategic review document with narrative content
- `source_docs/market_data.csv` — Quarterly performance data (revenue, targets, growth, market share)

## Sample Output

- `why-schools-need-decks-example.pdf` — Example exported deck generated by the skill

## Usage

Create a pipeline config pointing at the source files:

```json
{
  "project_name": "q4-results",
  "title": "Q4 2024 Strategic Review",
  "source_files": [
    "examples/demo-presentation/source_docs/q4_strategy_brief.md",
    "examples/demo-presentation/source_docs/market_data.csv"
  ],
  "output_root": "./output"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --config deck.config.json
```

## Expected Slides

1. Title slide

3. Financial performance (waterfall or bar chart)
4. Market expansion (growth chart)
5. Operational metrics (efficiency gains)
6. Challenges and mitigation (two-column layout)
7. Q1 2025 priorities (timeline or Gantt)
